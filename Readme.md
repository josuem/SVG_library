# SVG Collection
A simple collection of SVG files used to create schematic experimental setups using [Inkscape software](https://inkscape.org/).

These SVG files are a compilation of online SVG files and personal schematics.

## Folders
- **10_symbols**: General symbols for schematics such as electronics and mechanics.
- **20_instruments**: Commercial and generic instruments to add to experimental setups.
- **30_parts**: Generic parts or elements such as screws, BNC connectors, etc.

## File Naming Convention
### Instruments
Each file has a descriptive name following this convention:
- First, a short description of the element.
- Separated by a dot, the company of the instrument.
- Lastly, the model used in the image.

For example: `voltmeter.agilent_1234.svg`
